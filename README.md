Tutorials in Robotics, Computer vision and Deep learning as well as UAVs Guidance, Control and Navigation.

## Getting Started

Learn robotics with ROS and control your drone with MAVROS or Dronekit. Use Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques with OpenCV, Tensorflow and Pytorch to improve its autonomous features.

### Description

I would like as many people as possible to participate in my future projects, whether they are experience in related fields or just people who find it interesting. Any suggestions how to improve any of the project are more than welcomed as well as new ideas. These tutorials are meant for people without experience who want to start with UAVs, robotics, computer vision and deep learning.

We'll start with Computer Vision and learn processing of images and videos. It will be useful for later applications where we are going to use it for face detection, face recognition, image segmentation, image and video classifications...

All those applications are we going to use for our Guidance, Control and Navigation purposes. One of the most exciting usage is going to be object avoidance algorithms, but there will be many more.
